# The Book Club

The Book Club serves as a website for avid readers to sign up for a monthly book club. The genres focused on are Crime, Thriller and Fantasy. The age is open to anyone with an interest in reading. 

The website has information for users including: book club meeting times, the opening hours for the book shop where the book club takes place, the address of the shop and any accessibility information that disabled users may need to know, current and future reads, monthly author reads and their times as well as a sign-up form.

The Book Club aims to connect readers of the specified genres to each other in a comfortable, relaxing environment.
The Book Club will keep users up to date on current and future reading material with links to buy the books.
The book Club will improve profits of the book shop it is located in. When the book shops' website is live all purchase links will link to the book shop instead of Amazon.

 ### Colour Scheme

 The [color hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) website was used to choose a colour scheme.
 The main colours chosen for the colour scheme was a mix of white and black as well as shades of green. Green is a relaxing colour which matches the theme of a comfortable book club. This gives users a relaxed feeling when visiting the site. The overall colour scheme was to make users relaxed. But by combining these with the choice of images created a mysterious persona that encourages users to delve deeper into the website. The images were chosen with consideration to the types of book genres that were chosen.

 ### Wireframes

 I used Balsamiq Wireframes to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the website.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

### Header - Logo and Navigation

 - The header is fully responsive and contains the logo, navigation to the home, reading list and sign-up pages as well as the social media links. It is situated on all website pages. 
 - The navigation bar allows users easy navigation around the website across all devices without having to use the browsers 'back' button. The Social media icons open links in external pages for the same reasons.
 - The navigation bar can be displayed across the header or as a drop-down menu to make the most of screen real estate. On larger screens all internal links are interactive when hovered over to tell users they are clickable links.
 - The colour scheme of dark green matches the book genres The Book Club read.

### The Landing page image
 - The landing page includes an image with text overlay to tell users the genre of books we are focusing on at the moment. A content box with a enthralling description of the currently read book will get users to continue further into the site.
 - The image is mysterious and dark to match the style of writing of our current author M. W. Craven. 
 - The colour scheme of blacks, whites and greys matches the overall colour scheme of the website. 
 - On small devices the context box is only partially in view encouraging users to scroll down.

 - The user will see the benefit of joining us because we offer more than just a book reading club. 
 - A single sentence containing all information gives users instant gratification. 
 - The high contrast of white compared to the surrounding sections makes a clear separation of sections.

### Footer - contact information

 - The footer section includes all access information for the books shop where The Book Club is hosted. 
 - The footer is valuable as it tells users where to go, the opening times, any access issues that might be needed as well as a contact number. 

![alt text](footer.png)

### Reading List

 - The reading list is split into two main sections. The current book and future books.
 - When opening the reading list, the page opens up to a picture of the book, the title and author, a descriptive paragraph and a buy button.
 - This is valuable to the user as they can easily find what book they currently need to join.
 - The future list is below with similar information that was previously stated. As well as information telling users to sign up to get a vote. 
 - This is valuable to give users insight into future use and reminds them to sign up for more information. 
 - The buy button is there to encourage users to get involved straight away. The link is external to ensure the user stays on The Book Club page. It would link to the book shop page to buy if it existed but amazon was chosen for ease of use to the user.
