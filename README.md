##Features

## home page
### Header - Logo and Navigation

- The header is fixed at the top of the page so users can easily access any part of the website they require. 
- It contains the Logo 'The Book Club' to immedialty tell users the intent of the website. As well as the navigation menu to access the rest of the site.
- The colour scheme of the website is predominantly black and white for easy contrast betweeen sections as well as accessibility. The header is a dark green background with black font. This colour matches the themes of books the club focuses on to entiice interested users more. 
- The navigation menu contains all page links as well as socialmedia icons for ease of access. These are interactive headings and icons which underline when hovered over. This tells users they are there to be clicked to access more information. 
- The navigation menu is displayed as a dropdown menu on smaller screens to take up less real-estate. The three lines icon is common and undestood by many internet users. On larger screens the navigation bar is dispalyed along the header for immediate access to uses. 
- Users need this header to clearly understand the purpose of the website, as well as easy access to the rest of the websites services. 

### Hero Image and content box

- The hero image is an artisitc iamge of a detective to engage readers and immediatly tell users one of the main genres teh book club focuses on.
- The color scheme of the image is black, white and grey to match the bulk of the websites sections but also portrays the gloomy writing styles of M. W. Craven in his book 'The Puppet Show'. The artisitc style of the image is jagged and blurred, matching the persona of the books main protaganist and his mysterious past. 
- The content box tells the reader it is crime month for instant gratification that they will be interested in the genres we cover.
- The description in the content box is of this months book 'The puppet Show'. An inticing snippet that really sells the book as a unique read and elluring story line. 
- The content boxes blue backgorund is a good contrast on the chosen white text for ease of access.
- Users will use this image as a basis for books the club focus. The monthly genre shows that we rotate out choices so even if they dont like crime it is worth checking future reads. 

### Reasons section

- The reasons section contatins a single sentence summarising all of the content on the page. 
- A capitalized heading drags readers eyes to the contents of the website. 
- Blue text on a white background is consistent with the overall theme as well as a strong contrast to both sections above and below. Whilst it is bold enough for users to focus on, it has less images and detail than both sections above and below as they hold more relevant information for users to be get the best experience of the website. 
- Users will find this useful as a summary of the services we provide that have not been addressed in the hero image.

### events section

- The events section lists three main services the book club revolves around. The book club, hot food and drinks, and author meets.
- Each section contains a black and white image to clearly accompany the heading of each section. As well as a dark green sentence that includes the need to know information about the times of each section.
- The book event includes weekly timings of the book club to tell users if they can attend. 
- The food and drink section says that they are availalbe any time of the week to tell users that they can still access the book shop where it is located any day of the week. 
- The iamge for the author section shows a portrait of a man reading to show the author reads and meets that are hosted each month, as well as the times these occur. 
- The sentences with the specific timings are coloured the same as the heading box. This draws users to key information they need for access to the clubs services.
- On small screens the images stack in a column formation for scrolling. On larger screens these appear in a row to better fill space and improve the design. 
- Users will find this information valuable to see if they can attend any of the events on display. But also reminding users that the book shop is open everyday so they can still access the services.

### Reading List - Current Read
- The reading list opens with an enalrged image of the current book to show users the current book selection. 
- Accompanying this is the title, authors name and a short, snappy description of the book to entice the readers in. As well as a buy now button. This would be a link to the actual book shop to promote sales, however I have chosen Amazon as it is familiar to many users.
- The information follows the same color scheme as the home page to highlight where the key information is that the user needs to read. The blue background is the same as the book description on the home page to link the two qoutes together. 
-This is valuable ot the readers as it entices them to join with emotive language and clear instructions to buy the book.

### book seperation
- The book seperation folllws the same style as the page to follw on from the user learning key information from these sections. 
- It reminds readers to sign up for their uinpuit on future. This is to prevent users form clicking on the buy now buttons and leaving the site without submitting their interest. 
- This is valuable to the reader to remind them to sign up and that they have an input on the book clubs future reads. 

### Future reads
- This section contains three books of choice for the following months. These are all big titles that are in current circulation to interest readers more. 
- Each book holds minimal information. The books image, the title, the authors name and a buy now button. 
- The images are clear and contrast well from the black background, the White text also.
- Each buy now button is situated underneath the books to clearly state that there are links to each one.
