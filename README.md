### Reading List

- The reading list is split into two main sections. The current book and future books.
- When opening the reading list the page opens up to a picture of the book, the title and author, a descriptive paragraph and a buy button.
- This is valuable to the user as they can easily find what book they currently need to join.
- The future list is below with similar information that was previously stated. As well as information telling users to sign up to get a vote. 
- This is valuable to give users insight into future use and reminds them to sign up for more information. 
- The buy button is there to encourage users to get involved straight away. The link is external to ensure the user stays on The Book Club page. It would link to the book shop page to buy if it existed but amazon was chosen for ease of use to the user.

### Bugs 

- The meta tags were improperly inputted. The correct element was 'name'. I had put 'names' across all pages. Now fixed.
